This repository is created for COSC499 individual GitHub exercise. In this exercise, I will create a simple Java program with two independent features that is based off sorting arrays.

## Features
1. Sorting **integer** arrays
2. Sorting **string** arrays

### Sorting Integer Arrays
This function will sort an integer array based on element value from smallest to largest

### Sorting String Arrays
This function will sort a string array based on the first alphabet of an element and sort the array into alphabetical order.
